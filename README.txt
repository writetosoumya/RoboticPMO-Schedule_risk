#  Robotic PMO ‚Äì AI-Native Prototype  
### Predictive Schedule Risk Intelligence for Program & Portfolio Management

---

## Overview
**Robotic PMO** is an **AI-native solution** designed to predict schedule risks within a Program & Portfolio Management (PPM) landscape.  
It is purpose-built to operate even in **non-integrated, data-sparse environments**, enabling PMOs and transformation leaders to bring AI-powered foresight into project governance.

This working prototype uses **machine learning and rule-based intelligence** to analyze task-level data, identify at-risk milestones, and generate **predictive insights** for decision-making  without requiring a connected ecosystem.

## Key Capabilities
| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Schedule Risk Prediction** | Uses supervised ML and rule-based logic to flag tasks that may slip within 10 days. |
| **Agentic AI Q&A Interface** | Allows users to query schedule risks using natural language (with or without voice). |
| **Explainable Insights** | Offers rationale behind each predicted risk, ensuring transparency for PMO decision-makers. |
| **Modular & Scalable Design** | Built to onboard additional work-cluster-specific use cases (Scope, Change, Knowledge, etc.). |
| **Industry-Agnostic Framework** | Designed to fit any enterprise PPM landscape, regardless of tools or integration maturity. |
